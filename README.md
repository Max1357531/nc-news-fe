# EchoPress

This full-stack web application is interfaces with my [Backend API](https://github.com/Max1357531/nc-news) to provide a discussion board for news articles, complete with a commenting and 'upvoting' system. The goal of this project was to put together a fullstack project using free hosting resources available online.

> The front end of this project is hosted [here](https://nc-news-fe-vercel.vercel.app/).
> N.B. the free backend hosting service ([render](https://render.com/)) spinsdown after inactivity. Please be aware that it will take ~60 seconds for the backend service to spin up. Allow for this time between loading the webpage for the first time and exploring the webpage.
